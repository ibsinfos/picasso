Quick post something to Buddypress activity from anywhere on the site

== Description ==

Buddypress Quick Activity allow the Buddypress members of your site to quick post something to thier activity wall from anywhere on the site on any of your existing pages.
With Buddypress by default, posting to activity is possiable only from the Activity tab of a member’s profile page. 
However, Buddypress Quick Activity plugin let you add “Quick Activity” buttons to any of your post, pages or template files.

I have not planned on this plugin or have any plans for it for the future. However, you are more than welcome to send suggestion to info@geomywp.com. If the plugin will get attention and requestes i will be more than happy to extend it and its features.
